      <section>
        <h3>Problem 1: Some uses of EXISTS are not defined during evaluation</h3>
      <pre class="nohighlight box">
The evalution of exists in 18.6 is only defined for graph patterns, but in
  SELECT ?x WHERE {
    ?x :p :c .
    FILTER EXISTS { SELECT ?y { ?y :q :c . } } }
the argument to exists ends up being a ToMultiSet, which is not listed under
"Graph Pattern" in the table of SPARQL algebra symbols in 18.2.

The argument to exists is not explicitly listed as a "Graph Pattern" when
the argument to EXISTS is a GroupGraphPattern containing just a SubQuery or
just an InlineData.  Here the join is simplified away by section 18.2.2.8
leaving a construct in the SPARQL algebra that is not listed as a graph
pattern symbol, ToMultiSet or a multiset, respectively.  An example of where
this happens (but not at the top level of an EXISTS) is the last example of
18.2.3.
</pre>

      <section>
        <h3>Problem 2: Substitution happens where definitions are only for variables</h3>
<pre class="nohighlight box">
In
  SELECT ?x WHERE {
    BIND ( :d AS ?x )
    FILTER EXISTS { BIND ( :e AS ?z ) { SELECT ?x { :b :p :c } } } }
the substitution from 18.6 ends up with a non-variable in the second argument
to Project
  Join ( Extend( BGP(), ?z, :e ) ,
         ToMultiSet( Project( ToList( BGP( :b :p :c )), { :d } ) ) )
However Project is only defined in 18.5 for variables in its second argument.

This also affects Extend, multisets, BOUND, and maybe other constructs.
</pre>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Problem 3: Blank nodes substituted into BGPs act as variables</h3>
<pre class="nohighlight box">
In
  SELECT ?x WHERE {
    ?x :p :d .
    FILTER EXISTS { ?x :q :b . } }
against the graph { _:c :p :d , :e :q :b }
the substitution from 18.6 ends up producing
  BGP(_:c :q :b)
when then matches against :e :q :b because the _:c can be mapped to :e by
the RDF instance mapping that is part of pattern instance mappings in
18.3.1.

Some implementations diverge from the spec here.
</pre>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Problem 4: Substitution can flip MINUS to its disjoint-domain case</h3>
<pre class="nohighlight box">
In
  SELECT ?x WHERE {
    ?x :p :c .
    FILTER EXISTS { ?x :p :c . MINUS { ?x :p :c . } } }
on the graph { :d :p :c }
the substitution from 18.6 ends up producing
  Minus( BGP( :d :p :c ), BGP( :d :p :c ) )
which produces a non-empty result because the two solution mappings for the
Minus have disjoint domains and 18.5 dictates that then the result is not
empty.

Some implementations diverge from the spec here.
</pre>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Problem 5: Substitution affects disconnected variables</h3>
<pre class="nohighlight box">
In
  SELECT ?x WHERE {
    BIND ( :d AS ?x )
    FILTER EXISTS { BIND ( :e AS ?z )
                    SELECT ?y WHERE { ?x :p :c } } }
the substitution from 18.6 ends up producing
  Join ( Extend( BGP(), ?z :e ),
         ToMultiSet( Project( ToList( BGP( :d :p :c ) ), { ?y } ) ) )

Some, but not all, implementations diverge from the spec here.

        <h3>Translation of <tt>VALUES</tt></h3>

        <p>
          Near the end of section
          "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlTranslateGraphPatterns"
            >18.2.2.6 Translate Graph</a>" the translation of
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#data-block">inline data</a>
            should result in a <tt>ToMultiSet(data)</tt>.
          </p>
          <p>Translation of a trailing <tt>VALUES</tt> already uses this form.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
            For each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#rDataBlock">DataBlock</a>,
            form a solution mapping from the variable in the corresponding position in list of variables (or single variable),
            omitting a binding if the BindingValue is the word UNDEF.
          </p><p>
            Combine each solution mappings into a solution sequence S, and apply <tt>ToMultiSet<tt>.
            <pre class="codeBlock">The result is ToMultiset(S)</pre>
          </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The text in 18.2.4.3 then needs to be aligned:
            <tt>ToMultiSet(data)</tt> becomes <tt>translate(data)</tt>.
