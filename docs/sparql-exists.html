        <h3>Issue 1: Some uses of EXISTS are not defined during evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          The evaluation process in the specificiation is defined for graph patterns but
          there are situations where the evaluation is of an alegbra form not
          listed.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">FILTER EXISTS { SELECT ?y { ?y :q :c . } }</pre>
        and
        <pre class="nohighlight box">FILTER EXISTS { VALUES ?y { 123 } }</pre>
        <p>
          The argument to 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#defn_evalExists"><code>exists</code></a>
          is not explicitly listed as a "Graph Pattern" in the table of SPARQL algebra symbols in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlQuery">section 18.2</a>
          when the argument to <code>EXISTS</code> is a 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#rGroupGraphPattern">GroupGraphPattern</a>
          containing just a 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#subqueries">subquery</a>
          or just 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#inline-data">InlineData</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Issue 2: Substitution happens where definitions are only for variables</h3>

        <p>There are places in the SPARQL syntax and algebra where
          variables are allowed but not RDF terms (constant values).<p>

        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">FILTER EXISTS { BIND ( :e AS ?z ) { SELECT ?x { :b :p :c } } } }</pre>

        <p>Both positions "AS ?z" and "SELECT ?x" must be variables.</p>

        <p>In the algebra, this affects</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#defn_extend"><code>extend</code></a>
            (related to the use of <code>AS</code> in SPARQL syntax)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#inline-data">in line data</a> 
          ((related to the use of <code>VALUES</code>)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#func-bound"><code>BOUND</code></a></li>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Issue 3: Blank nodes substituted into BGPs act as variables</h3>

        <p>In the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#BasicGraphPattern"
             >evaluation of basic graph patterns</a> 
          (BGPs) blank nodes 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#BGPsparql">are replaced</a>
          by RDF terms from the graph being matched and variables are replaced by a solution
          mapping from query variables to RDF terms so that the  basic graph pattern is
          now a subgraph of the graph being matched.
        </p>
        <p>Simply substituting a variable with a blank node in the <code>EXISTS</code>
          evaluation process does not cause the basic graph pattern to be 
          to be restricted to subgraphs containing that blank node as an RDF term
          because it is mapped by an 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-mt-20040210/#definst">RDF instance
          mapping</a> before checking that the BGP after mapping is a subgraph of the
          graph being queried.
        </p>
        <p>Note that elsewhere in the evaluation of the SPARQL algebra, a solution
          mapping with a binding from variable to blank node, does treat blank nodes
          as RDF terms. They are not mapped by an RDF instance mapping.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">SELECT ?x WHERE {
    ?x :p :d .
    FILTER EXISTS { ?x :q :b . } }</pre>
        <p>
          against the graph <tt>{ _:c :p :d , :e :q :b }</tt>
          the substitution for <code>EXISTS</code> produces
          <tt>BGP(_:c :q :b)</tt> which then
          matches against <tt>:e :q :b</tt> because the <tt>_:c</tt> can be mapped to <tt>:e</tt> by
          the RDF instance mapping that is part of pattern instance mappings in 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#BGPsparql">18.3.1</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Issue 4: Substitution can flip MINUS to its disjoint-domain case</h3>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">
In
  SELECT ?x WHERE {
    ?x :p :c .
    FILTER EXISTS { ?x :p :c . MINUS { ?x :p :c . } } }
on the graph { :d :p :c }
the substitution from 18.6 ends up producing
  Minus( BGP( :d :p :c ), BGP( :d :p :c ) )
which produces a non-empty result because the two solution mappings for the
Minus have disjoint domains and 18.5 dictates that then the result is not
empty.
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Issue 5: Substitution affects disconnected variables</h3>
        <pre class="nohighlight box">
In
  SELECT ?x WHERE {
    BIND ( :d AS ?x )
    FILTER EXISTS { BIND ( :e AS ?z )
                    SELECT ?y WHERE { ?x :p :c } } }
the substitution from 18.6 ends up producing
  Join ( Extend( BGP(), ?z :e ),
         ToMultiSet( Project( ToList( BGP( :d :p :c ) ), { ?y } ) ) )

Some, but not all, implementations diverge from the spec here.

      <h2>An Alternative to Substitution</h2>
      <p>
        The process whereby evaluation of <code>EXISTS</code> takes place is defined by
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#defn_substitute">substitution</a>.
        This section proposes an alternative mechanism with 3 parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Renaming inner scope variables</li>
        <li>Disallowing setting variables via <code>extend</code> if the variable is in
          any possible the current row being filtered</li>
        <li>Restricting the RDF terms that a varibale can be mapped in in a solution
          mapping durign evaluation of <code>exists</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <section>
        <h3>Renaming</h3>

      <pre>== Definition: Projection Expression Variable Remapping

For a projection algebra operation P with set of variables PV, define

   F = mapping from V to V.
      such that
      F(v) = v if v in PV
      F(v) = v1, v1 a variable with a name not used in the query
                    and not used in any other projection mapping.

Define the project mapping PrjMap(P,PV) to be the algebra expression P (and the subtree
over which the projection is defined) with F applied to every variable of the algebra
expression over which P is evaluated.


== Definition: Variable Remapping

For any algebra expression X, not a projection:

PrjMap(X) = replace all project operations with  PrjMap(P,PV) for each projection in X.
</pre>


      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>No assignment</h3>
        <p>
          Assignment (an "AS" in SPARQL syntax) to a variable which is in-scope for the
          <tt>FILTER</tt> is not allowed.  Any potential variables in a "current row", are considered
          in-scope for the <code>EXIST</code> expression.
          Section <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#variableScope">18.2.1 Variable Scope</a>
          defines the set of variables that are in-scope in the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#rGroupGraphPattern">GroupGraphPattern</a>
          where the filter appears.
        </p>
        <p>This is a syntactic restriction and is added to the notes in section 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlGrammar">19.8 Grammar</a>.
          See also notes 12 qnd 13 that alrady apply.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Restriction of Bindings</h3>

        <p>The proposal is to retain the variables from the current row are retained, not
          substitute them for RDF terms before evaluation, but also restrict 
          the binding of the solution to the RDF term of the current row. This occurs
          after renaming.
        </p>
      <p>
      <p>
        Solution mappings define binding for variables in 3 places:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#BGPsparql">Basic Graph Pattern Matching</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#PropertyPathPatterns">Property Path Patterns</a></li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#defn_evalGraph">evaluation of algebra form
            <code>Graph(var,P)</code></a> involving a variable (from the syntax <code>GRAPH ?variable {...}</code>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that other place where solution mappings add varibales is in
        <code>extend</code> but the "no assignment" condition precludes this happening.
      </p>
      <p>Restricting the RDF Terms for a variable binding is done using
        inline data that is joined with the evalaution of the basic graph pattern,
        property path or graph match.</p>

<pre>== Definition: Replace(pattern, μ)

For solution mapping μ, define Table(μ) be the multiset forms from μ.

Table(μ) = ToMultiSet(solution sequence { μ })

Replace(X, μ) is
If X is a BGP ,
    replace X with join(X, Table(μ))

If X is a property path expression,
    replace X with join(P, Table(μ))

If X is Graph(Var, pattern)
    replace X with join(X, Table(μ))


== Definition: Evaluation of Exists

Let μ be the current solution mapping for a filter and X a graph pattern:

exists(X) = true if and only if
              eval(D(G), Replace(PrjMap(X), μ)
            is a non empty solution sequence.

exists(X) = false otherwise

      <h2>Solutions</h2>

      <p>This section addresses each issue identified, given the proposal above.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Issue 1: Some uses of EXISTS are not defined during evaluation</h3>
        
        <p>This can be handled by handling solution sequences as graph patterns where
          needed by adding 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#defn_algToMultiSet">toMultiSet</a>
          as is done fot <a href="#rSubSelect">SubSelect</a>
          in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlTranslateGraphPatterns">18.2.2.6 Translate Graph Patterns</a>
          with a a correction to the text at the end of
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlQuery">Section 18.2</a>
          introductory paragraph.
        </p>

<pre>query-errata-N:

"Section 18.2 Translation to the SPARQL Algebra" intro (end):

ToMultiSet can be used where a graph pattern is mentioned below because the
outcome of evaluating a graph pattern is a multiset.

Multisets of solution mappings are elements of the SPARQL algebra.  Multisets
of solution mappings count as graph patterns.
